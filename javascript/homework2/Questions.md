## Theoretical question

1. Describe in your own words what the functions in programming are for. 

In programming for not repeatedly writing the same code, we create a function which execute some amount of code accordingly based on arguments. Next time just with giving values to these arguments we can directly get result by calling a function without repeating writing steps.



2. Describe in your own words what is the reason why arguments are defined in a function. Why are they passed when a function is called?

Arguments are defined in a function in order to to define which operations will be executed based on these specific arguments and  then just by passing different values to arguments we kind of assigning roles to values and tell them from which operations they should exactly go through.

We should pass values to arguments in order to get result based on these values when function is called.
