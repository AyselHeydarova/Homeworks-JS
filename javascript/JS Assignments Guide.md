Some of the home assignments are separated into 2 parts: theoritcal and practical.

**The theoretical part**'s main goal is to determine how well do you understand the question. The answer mustn't be copied from a book or an article. You should answer the question in a few lines, exactly how you would answer it on an interview. 

The answer to this part of the assignment should be written in a specific file with an `md` extension. This is the format that's being used for this document. 

**The practical part** can contain both mandatory and optional assignments. The mandatory part must be done fully. You *should not* begin doing the optional part before the mandatory part is done fully. If you have succesfully done the mandatory part and are ready to move on to the optional one - please create a new file for it where possible. This will help checking your homework significantly.

Good luck!
